Introduction {#intro}
============

The Magnetometer Sensor extends the Generic Sensor API [[GENERIC-SENSOR]]
to provide information about the <a>geomagnetic field</a>
as detected by the device's primary magnetometer sensor.
The magnetometer sensor measures the ambient <a>geomagnetic field</a> for all three
physical axes (x, y, z) in μT (micro Tesla).

<dfn>Geomagnetic field</dfn> is defined as the magnetic force field that surrounds the Earth.
It is attributed to the combined effects of the planetary rotation and the movement of molten iron in the Earth's' core.


A magnetoresistive component (permalloy) is one which changes resistance in proportion to the strength of a magnetic field along its axis.
The 3 axis magnetometer usually found in mobile phones, have 3 such components oriented such that each one is orthogonal to the other two,
one each in the X, Y and Z directions in the device's <a>local coordinate system</a>.
Each individual magnetoresistive element senses only the component of the magnetic field parallel to the element axis and ignores field components orthogonal to the element axis.


Examples {#examples}
========

<div class="example">
    <pre highlight="js">
    let sensor = new MagnetometerSensor();
    sensor.start();

    sensor.onchange = function(event) {
        console.log("MagneticField along the X-axis " + event.reading.magneticFieldX);
        console.log("MagneticField along the Y-axis " + event.reading.magneticFieldY);
        console.log("MagneticField along the Z-axis " + event.reading.magneticFieldZ);
    };

    sensor.onerror = event => console.log(event.error.name, event.error.message);
    </pre>
</div>

Security and Privacy Considerations {#security-and-privacy}
===================================

There are no specific security and privacy considerations
beyond those described in the Generic Sensor API [[!GENERIC-SENSOR]].

Model {#model}
=====

The Magnetometer Sensor's associated <a>Sensor subclass</a>
is the {{MagnetometerSensor}} class.

The Magnetometer Sensor's associated <a>SensorReading subclass</a>
is the {{MagnetometerSensorReading}} class.

The Magnetometer Sensor has a <a>default sensor</a>,
which is the device's main magnetometer sensor.

The Magnetometer Sensor has a single <a>supported reporting mode</a>
which is "<a>auto</a>".

The Magnetometer Sensor's <a>permission</a> name is `"magnetometer"`.
It has no <a>associated PermissionDescriptor</a>.

The Magnetometer Sensor has an associated abstract operation
to <dfn>retrieve the sensor permission</dfn> which
must simply return a <a>permission</a> whose name is "magnetometer".

The Magnetometer Sensor has an associated abstract operation
to <dfn lt="Construct SensorReading Object">construct a SensorReading object</dfn>
which creates a new {{MagnetometerSensorReading}} object and sets each of its
<a attribute for="MagnetometerSensorReading">magneticFieldX</a>,
<a attribute for="MagnetometerSensorReading">magneticFieldY</a> and
<a attribute for="MagnetometerSensorReading">magneticFieldZ</a> attributes to zero.

The {{MagnetometerSensorReading}}'s attribute values must be in μT (micro Tesla),
expressed in a three-dimentional Cartesian <a>local coordinate system</a>
defined by the device.


Note: The <dfn>local coordinate system</dfn> of a mobile device is usually defined relative to
the device's screen when the device in its default orientation (see figure below).

API {#api}
===

The MagnetometerSensor Interface {#magnetometer-sensor-interface}
--------------------------------

<pre class="idl">
  [Constructor(optional SensorOptions sensorOptions)]
  interface MagnetometerSensor : Sensor {
    readonly attribute MagnetometerSensorReading? reading;
  };
</pre>

To <dfn>Construct an MagnetometerSensor Object</dfn> the user agent must invoke the
<a>construct a Sensor object</a> abstract operation.

The MagnetometerSensorReading Interface {#magnetometer-sensor-reading-interface}
---------------------------------------

<pre class="idl">
  [Constructor(MagnetometerSensorReadingInit magnetometerSensorReadingInit)]
  interface MagnetometerSensorReading : SensorReading {
      readonly attribute double magneticFieldX;
      readonly attribute double magneticFieldY;
      readonly attribute double magneticFieldZ;
  };

  dictionary MagnetometerSensorReadingInit {
    double magneticFieldX = 0;
    double magneticFieldY = 0;
    double magneticFieldZ = 0;
  };
</pre>

### The MagnetometerSensorReading constructor ### {#magnetometer-sensor-reading-constructor}

The MagnetometerSensorReading constructor accepts {{MagnetometerSensorReadingInit}} dictionary that is used for initialization of {{MagnetometerSensorReading}} attributes.



### The MagnetometerSensorReading attributes ### {#magnetometer-sensor-reading-attribute}

The <a attribute for="MagnetometerSensorReading">magneticFieldX</a> attribute of the {{MagnetometerSensorReading}}
interface represents represents the <a>geomagnetic field</a> around X-axis.

The <a attribute for="MagnetometerSensorReading">magneticFieldY</a> attribute of the {{MagnetometerSensorReading}}
interface represents represents the <a>geomagnetic field</a> around Y-axis.

The <a attribute for="MagnetometerSensorReading">magneticFieldZ</a> attribute of the {{MagnetometerSensorReading}}
interface represents represents the <a>geomagnetic field</a> around Z-axis.


Limitations of Magnetometer Sensors {#limitations-magnetometer}
==============

<em>This section is non-normative</em>.

The direction and magnitude of the Earth’s field changes with location, latitude in particular. For example,
the magnitude is lowest near the equator and highest near the poles.
Some hard-iron interference, meaning presence of permanent magnets (e.g. magnets in the speaker of a phone) in the vicinity of the sensor
also affects the accuracy of the reading.
Presence of electronic items, laptops, batteries, etc also contribute to the soft-iron interference.
Flight Mode option in mobile phones might help in decreasing the electro magnetic interference.

In addition to the above spatial variations of the <a>geomagnetic field</a>, time based variations,
like solar winds or magnetic storms, also distort the magnetosphere or external magnetic field of the earth.


Compass Heading using Magnetometers {#compass}
======================

Compasses, instruments that align themselves with the magnetic poles of the Earth, have been used in navigation for centuries.
The earth’s rotational axis defines the geographic north and south poles that we use for
map references. It turns out that there is a discrepancy of around 11.5 degrees (around 1000 miles) between the geographic poles and the
magnetic poles. <a>Declination angle</a> is applied to the magnetic direction to correct for this situation.

If the device is always level to the earth’s surface, compass heading can be determined by using just the
{{magneticFieldX}} and {{magneticFieldY}} component of the earth’s magnetic field, that
is, the directions planar with the earth’s surface.
To determine true north heading, add or subtract the appropriate <a>declination angle</a>.

<dfn>Magnetic declination</dfn> or <dfn>declination angle</dfn> is the angle on the horizontal plane between magnetic north and the true north and depends on the position on the Earth's surface, and changes over time.
By convention, declination is positive when magnetic north is east of true north, and negative when it is to the west. You can get real time value for <a>magnetic declination</a> from <a href="http://www.magnetic-declination.com/">this website</a>.

<div class="example">
  <pre highlight="js">
    sensor.onchange = function({ reading }) {
      const { magneticFieldX: x, magneticFieldY: y } = reading;
      let heading = (Math.atan2(x, y) * 180) / Math.PI;
      // Normalize heading.
      if (heading < 0) {
        heading += 2 * Math.PI;
      }

      if (heading > (2 * Math.PI)) {
        heading -= 2 * Math.PI;
      }

      const headingDegrees = heading * 180 / Math.PI;

      // use + if declination is EAST, use - if declination is WEST.
      const trueHeadingDegrees = headingDegrees + declinationAngle;
    }
    </pre>
</div>


If the device is not level to the earth’s surface, we need to apply various tilt compensation
techniques for which we need the a 3-axis accelerometer.

A specification for Orientation sensor, which is a fusion of the accelerometer and magnetometer sensors, will deal with this use case.
